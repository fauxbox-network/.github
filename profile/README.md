# Fauxbox
Fauxbox is an open source replacement to Xbox Live that attempts to build custom servers for the Xbox 360.

## Why is there only one repository?
Fauxbox is currently in limbo, as we are waiting for until all of the original Xbox 360 online play servers are shut down.

## Acknowledgements/Credits
This project is heavily inspired by Pretendo, Insignia, and various other revival services.

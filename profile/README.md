# Fauxbox
Fauxbox is an open source replacement to Xbox Live that attempts to build custom servers for the Xbox 360.

## Why is there only one repository?
Fauxbox is currently in limbo, as we are waiting for until all of the original Xbox 360 online play servers are shut down to begin development. There are multiple reasons for this, none of which will be discussed here.

## Acknowledgements/Credits
This project is heavily inspired by Pretendo, Insignia, and various other revival services.
